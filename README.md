# Backend
The backend of this application is based on the MERN (**M**ongoDB, **E**xpress, **R**eact, and **N**odeJS) Stack. MongoDB serves as the database and use NodeJS to manage the web server. Mongoose is used to connect the MongoDB database to the NodeJS server. Express is the framework that is the middleware between the frontend and the NodeJS server and is useful for routing client requests.
