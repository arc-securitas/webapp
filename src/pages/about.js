                    <p>We envision a world in which people can feel safe in their everyday lives, including in their careers. However, from our extensive research, we know that client-facing real estate professionals fear for their personal safety. Yet, there is no industry-wide solution for employee safety management. We integrate various safety-oriented features into a system that streamlines processes for the brokerage, providing peace of mind for everyone while improving firm efficiency. Arc is our contribution towards the world we envision.</p>

                    <p><strong>We were founded with the mission</strong> to reinvent real estate safety</p>

                    <p>During our early days being exposed to real estate, we heard stories from agents that shocked us and highlighted the dangers inherent to the industry. Since then, weâ€™ve continued to hear stories every day. Every day, we hear real estate agents tell us how they fear for their own safety while on the job because there is no industry-wide safety solution. We believe in developing technology that helps combat this fear and ensure that real estate professionals can work safely and comfortably.</p>
